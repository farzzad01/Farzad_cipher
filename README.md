# Encryption Algorithm

This is a simple encryption algorithm implemented in Python. It takes a word or text as input, along with a key, and encrypts the input using a series of operations including word reversal, letter reflection, letter-to-number conversion, number addition, and number-to-letter conversion.

## Features

- Reverses the input word/text
- Reflects each letter of the reversed word
- Converts the reflected word into a sequence of numbers based on the alphabet position
- Adds corresponding key numbers to the sequence of numbers
- Converts the resulting numbers back into letters
- Reflects the encrypted word
- Displays the encrypted word as the output
